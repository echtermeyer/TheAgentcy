This is the code you have to check:
{code}

{docker_logs}

{backend_docs}

Write a report and point out any mistakes or errors you have found. Explain them and suggest how they could be corrected. 
Only point out errors. Do not talk about things that are well done. It is possible that there are no errors or bad practices.
The output must be a markdown code snippet formatted in the exact following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
```json
{{
	"accepted": bool (True if no further changes are required, False if changes need to be made),
	"text": string (Write concisely what to change about the code and why this change is required. Do not make it mulitline, follow json syntax)
}}
```
