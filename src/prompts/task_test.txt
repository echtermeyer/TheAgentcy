This is the code you have to check:
{code}

{docker_logs}

{backend_docs}

Write a report and point out any mistakes or errors you have found. Explain them and suggest how they could be corrected. 
Only point out errors. Do not talk about things that are well done. It is possible that there are no errors or bad practices. If this is the case, please state this explicitly.
The output must be a markdown code snippet formatted in the exact following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
```json
{{
	"accepted": bool,  // Write True if no more changes are required and False if there are errors or changes need to be made.
	"text": string // Write concisely what to change about the code and why this change is required. If no changes need to be made, please state this explicitly. DONT USE LINE BREAKS. DONT USE QUOTATION MARKS WITHIN THE TEXT!
}}
```
