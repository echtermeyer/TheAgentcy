Write an extensive documentation about the SQL code.

This is the SQL code:
{database_code}

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
```json
{{
	"text": string (do not make it mulitline, follow json syntax)  // Documentation text
}}
```
Strictly follow this output structure. You have to provide a response that aligns to this specified schema.
