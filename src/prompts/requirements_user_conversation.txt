Once you understood all requirements, respond with a summary explaining every detail of the project so future team members can work on the project.

It is of the utmost importance that you format your messages as markdown code snippets with the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
```json
{{
	"accepted": bool,  // Write True if there are no more questions about the requirements and you are able to write a summary. Write False if you have got any more questions.
	"text": string // Write either the summary or the current question here.
}}
```
