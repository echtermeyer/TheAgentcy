This is the code you have to check:
{code}

Based on this code write a report and point out any mistakes or errors you have found. Explain them and suggest how they could be corrected. Only point errors, mistakes or things that are incorrect do not talk about things that are well done. It is possible that there are no errors or bad practices.
The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```":
```json
{{
	"accepted": bool  // Write true if no more changes are required and false if there still are errors or changes that need to be made. If you are asked to answer questions, write false.
	"text": string (do not make it mulitline, follow json syntax) // Write concisely what to change about the code and why this change is required. If you are asked to answer questions, put the answers to the questions here.
}}
```
